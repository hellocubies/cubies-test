        Been on this website for a few minutes but still unsure about how to navigate it? Don’t worry, this guide will
        help answer your questions!

        <h2 class="help-item">GET CUBIES</h2>

        In the “Get Cubies” section, there’s a button called “Get My Lucky Cubie”. Once you click it, a file of a Cubie
        will pop up, and you’ll be able to download that file and print it out to make the Cubie. This section refreshes
        every two hours, so you’ll be able to get a new Cubie then. But beware, it’s possible to get a duplicate Cubie!

        <h2 class="help-item">CHECKLIST</h2>

        The “Checklist” section of the website has all the Cubies up to date. Once you get a Cubie, you can press the “I
        own this Cubie” button in order to confirm that you have to Cubie and to see that Cubie’s origin story. Click
        the image to enlarge it and click it again to return.

            <h2>Cubies. </h2>
            <p>What are they, you ask?</p>
            <p>Well, as you can see from our website, they are tiny cubes with cute designs on them, from animals to
                food.
                In a word, they are Cubies.</p>
            <p>
                Before they were Cubies, they were ideas and drawings by Cephalopod and his friends when they were in
                fourth
                grade. They hand drew them to create them until they realized that this method was extremely
                time-consuming.
                Just as soon as they realized this, their interests changed, and Cephalopod stopped making them.</p>
            <p>
                Now skip to a couple of years later. Cephalopod took interest in making these again, but’s time
                digitally.
                He really got into them, recruiting LilyFlower and RaiderX to help him out. They created many more of
                these
                cute crafts, naming them Cubies. From there, they decided to post them so that others could enjoy them
                too.
                And here they are. A website with all Cubies known to humans enjoyed by many others in the world.

                        The original Cubie maker, he is known for his originality and creativity. He first started
                        making
                        Cubies with his friends in fourth grade for fun. He quit soon after though as he lost interest.
                        He
                        picked up this idea again a couple of years later, though, and turned it into the huge thing it
                        is
                        today.
