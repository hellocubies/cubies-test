            <h2>Cubies. </h2>
            <p>What are they, you ask?</p>
            <p>Well, as you can see from our website, they are tiny cubes with cute designs on them, from animals to
                food.
                In a word, they are Cubies.</p>
            <p>
                Before they were Cubies, they were ideas and drawings by Cephalopod and his friends when they were in
                fourth
                grade. They hand drew them to create them until they realized that this method was extremely
                time-consuming.
                Just as soon as they realized this, their interests changed, and Cephalopod stopped making them.</p>
            <p>
                Now skip to a couple of years later. Cephalopod took interest in making these again, butâ€™s time
                digitally.
                He really got into them, recruiting LilyFlower and RaiderX to help him out. They created many more of
                these
                cute crafts, naming them Cubies. From there, they decided to post them so that others could enjoy them
                too.
                And here they are. A website with all Cubies known to humans enjoyed by many others in the world.

                    Cephalopod:
                    The original Cubie maker, he is known for his originality and creativity. He first started making
                    Cubies with his friends in fourth grade for fun. He quit soon after though as he lost interest. He
                    picked up this idea again a couple of years later, though, and turned it into the huge thing it is
                    today.
